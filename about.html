        <p class="abtp">"If I cannot outsmart them, I will outfight them" â€“ Dota 2. This is a popular quote of the game Dota 2, This is applicable in real life as well. People see gaming as it is not part of their living style or family specially in India, But this thinking is not absolute!
            I am Aezuz a gamer, programmer and a main member of SleiGhT, I Started gaming just out of Passion and now the community has widespread , so I thought I can make this push into something bigger.</p>
        <p class="abtp1">Earlier i was a part of Phoenix eSports, but then i decided to make my own team - SleiGhT. Currently I am chasing my dream of making my team win the VCT, and beat the top teams of the world.</p>
